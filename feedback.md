I understand that the previous steps didn't resolve the issue. I sincerely apologize for the continued difficulty.

However, I cannot proceed without the specific debugging information I requested. The phrase "that didn't work" doesn't give me any new information about the current error, what the server is responding with, or what is being logged on your server.

**To help you further, it is absolutely essential that you provide the following debugging information:**

1.  **Raw Network Response from Browser Developer Tools (for the `/api/admin/users` request):**
    *   Open your browser's developer tools (F12, then "Network" tab).
    *   Navigate to the `/admin/users` page in your application.
    *   Find the request made to `/api/admin/users`.
    *   Click on this request and go to the **"Response" tab**.
    *   **Copy and paste the *entire content* of this "Response" tab here.** This is essential to see what data (or error message) the API is actually returning.

2.  **Server-Side Logs from your Next.js Development Server (at the moment you access `/admin/users`):**
    *   Go back to the terminal window where your Next.js development server is running.
    *   **Copy and paste *all* new error messages, warnings, or any output (including the `--- Supabase Server Client Init ---` and `--- Supabase Client Object ---` logs) that appeared in that terminal when you navigated to `/admin/users`.** This will confirm if the previous errors are truly resolved and if there are any new errors on the server-side.

**Please provide *both* pieces of information in your next response.** This is the only way I can understand the current state of your application and proceed with a solution.

Thank you for your continued patience. Please re-confirm that you are logged in as `vinnywalker96@gmail.com` (your super admin account) when performing these steps.
